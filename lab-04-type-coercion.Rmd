# Learning goals

-   Learn how data types are coerced (changed automatically) by R
-   Practice creating mixed type vectors
-   Practice using explicit data coercion functions

```{r photo, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.cap = "Data Coercion Figure - Hands-on Programming in R G. Grolemund", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-coercion.png")
```

## Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.

-   Update the YAML, changing the author name to your name, and **knit** the document. 🧶
-   Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message. ✅
-   Push your changes to GitHub.️ ⬆️
-   Go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd files.

## Data

For the first 6 exercises, we will use data objects we will create ourselves.
The last 4 exercises will use the `earthquakes` dataset from the `{openintro}` package we have used before and we will also need `{tidyverse}` for some data wrangling.

## Packages

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
```

## Warm up

Before we start the lab, let's warm up by changing the YAML in the starter file:

-   Update the YAML, changing the author name to your name, and **knit** the document. 🧶
-   Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message. ✅
-   Push your changes to GitHub.️ ⬆️
-   Go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd files.

# Lab Exercises

1.  Let's start by generating some vectors to work with that contains data of different types:

-   Copy the three code chunks below into Exercise 1 in your Lab 04 starter file.
-   Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object.
-   Beneath the **second** code chunk, add text narrative explaining why the output of the first code chunk is different from the second.
-   Finally, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **third** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

**NOTE** Don't worry about code chunk labels in this Lab *unless* we tell you to add them.

Vector `c(1, 1L, "C")`

```{r echo = F}
1
1L
"C"
```

```{r echo = F}
c(1, 1L, "C")
```

```{r echo = F}
#typeof(c(1, 1L, "C"))
```

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

### End of Exercise 1

2.  Let's try that again for a different vector:

-   Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 2 in your Lab 04 starter file.
-   Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object.
-   Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

Vector `c(1:3, 5)`

```{r echo = F}
1:3
5
```

```{r echo = F}
#typeof(c(1:3, 5))
```

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

### End of Exercise 2

3.  Let's try that again for a different vector:

-   Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 3 in your Lab 04 starter file.
-   Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object.
-   Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

Vector `c(3, FALSE, T)`

```{r echo = F}
3 
FALSE
T
```

```{r echo = F}
#typeof(c(3, FALSE, T))
```

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

### End of Exercise 3

4.  Let's try that again for a different vector:

-   Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 4 in your Lab 04 starter file.
-   Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object.
-   Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

Vector `c(TRUE, as.numeric(TRUE))`

```{r echo = F}
TRUE
as.numeric(TRUE)
```

```{r echo = F}
#typeof(c(TRUE, as.numeric(TRUE)))
```

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

### End of Exercise 4

5.  Let's try that again for a different vector:

-   Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 5 in your Lab 04 starter file.
-   Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object.
-   Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

Vector `c(NA, FALSE, as.logical(1))`

```{r echo = F}
NA
FALSE
as.logical(1)
```

```{r echo = F}
#typeof(c(NA, FALSE, as.logical(1)))
```

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

### End of Exercise 5

6.  Let's try that one last time for a final vector:

-   Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 6 in your Lab 04 starter file.
-   Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object.
-   *include the numerator and denominator of the division, separately, as well as the overall division operation together*
-   Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

Vector `c(1L / 0, "A")`

```{r echo = F}
1L
0
1L / 0
"A"
```

```{r echo = F}
#typeof(c(1L / 0, "A"))
```

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

### End of Exercise 6

You can stop here until we continue the lecture.

## Last 4 Exercises: With "real" data

7.  Write and label a code chunk below exercise 7 in your starter file that gives you a "glimpse" of the `earthquakes` dataset.

### End of Exercise 7

8.  Under exercise 8, state which of the variables could be explicitly coerced to new data types, without any loss of information. Try to identify at least two.

### End of Exercise 8

9.  If we coerced `year` to type *character*, what visualization problems may arise if we tried to recreate the plot from Homework 1 which mapped `year` to the x-axis and `richter` to the y-axis?

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

### End of Exercise 9

10. Copy the code chunk below into exercise 10 in your starter file, then label and complete it! This pipeline should:\

-   create a new variable called `major` which takes on the value `TRUE` for `richter > 7.5`;
-   coerce the new variable to type numeric;
-   filter only for the major earthquakes.

```{r label-me, eval = F}
___ %>% 
  mutate(major = case_when(
    ___ > 7.5 ~ TRUE,
    TRUE ~ ___
  )) %>% 
  mutate(___ = as.numeric(___)) %>% 
  filter(___ == ___)
```

Remember to set eval = T to knit your starter file.

-   Question: **How many major earthquakes are there in this dataset?** Add your response as text.

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

### End of Exercise 10

Good job, you're done with Lab 4!
